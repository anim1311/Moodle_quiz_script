# Moodle_quiz_script

## Description

Tired of those mind-numbing, repetitive tasks your professor assigned? Look no further! This script is here to save the day (and your sanity).

## What is this?

This script is my personal hero for tackling the monotonous Moodle quiz tasks. Say goodbye to manual labor and hello to efficiency!

## Disclaimer

While this script is designed to make your life easier, it can't do your laundry or walk your dog (yet). Please use it responsibly.

## How it works

1. **Install**: Simply download and run the script. It's so easy, that even your pet goldfish could do it (if they had opposable thumbs).

2. **Sit Back and Relax**: Let the script do its magic. Grab a coffee, catch up on your favorite show, or contemplate the meaning of life - the choice is yours.

3. **Bask in Glory**: When the script does not work!

4. **Time to Code**: time to spend more effort to make automation that does the work for you, which you can do faster!

## Bugs and Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues, don't panic. Just report them in the issues section and I'll summon my debugging wand.

## Credits

Huge thanks to all the caffeine that fueled this project, and to anyone who's ever dreamt of a world without mindless Moodle tasks.


Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use this script wisely and make your professor proud (or at least less annoyed with Moodle). Happy automating!
